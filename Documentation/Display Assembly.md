### Tools and Other
- Files
  - Used to file 3D printed parts as needed
- Allen wrench

## Split-Flap Cards
- Place a card under the "Split" jig so that the lip of the jig is on the outside of the card
  - The jig falls at the middle of the card
- Use an x-acto knife to score a line down the middle of the card at the jig
- Bend the card back and forth until it breaks along the score line
  - I also found it useful to bend the card, turn it over, and score the opposite side of the card along the bend line
- On either side of the card, use the "Hole" jig to position the Card Slot Hole Punch and punch a slot/hole on either side
  - This will form the small spoke-like sections which can be inserted into the spool holes
  - Use an x-acto knife to clean up the holes as needed
- (Optional) Use rubbing alchohol to clean both sides of the card from any dirt and oils from handling the cards
- Place the desired stencil on the card and fill-in using a permenant marker
  - For digits, the number spans two cut cards (i.e. one full uncut card length)
  - I used painters tape to hold the cards and stencil in place
