# Split-Flap-Clock
Clock using a split-flap display

# Background
In December 2023, I bought my first microcontroller. I first began working on a similar project using a split-flap display to show number of instagram followers which I began in February 2024. I began this project in November 2024 seeking to build on what I learned through the previous project. The goal of this project is to create a split-flap display clock with a self-setting time feature. I will be using a Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller and 3D printed split-flap displays.

## Components

### 14-Flap Split-Flap Display
The split-flap displays were designed primarily from [Scott Bezek's work](https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap). The primary alteration is mine is a 14-flap version since I am primarily interested in displaying numbers. I found 14 flaps was a good compromise in reducing the overall dimensions while leaving enough room for certain components (e.g. magnet in the spool section for the Hall sensor). The overall dimensions of each display is:
- Width: 90mm
- Height: 133mm
- Depth: 60mm
